		<h1>Goals of Project:</h1>
		

		<p> The purpose of my research was to examine and investigate the following: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The process in which the A.I. is programmed and how its codes are written. </li>
			<li> How such intricate software can be compared to the way in which human beings process and relay information.</li>
			<li>How A.I. can assist in propelling mankind into the next age of innovation.</li>
			<li> The possible ethical issues that might arise once A.I. becomes more intelligent: Should they continue to be viewed as objects and tools? Or should they be considered a type of life form with its their freedom and rights?</li>

		</ul>
